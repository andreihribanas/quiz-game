# Project description

Simple quiz game developed using JavaScript and jQuery library for animations and various effects. Tried to build a version of the "Who wants to be a millionaire" game. <br>

It uses the questions.js file to render the questions on the screen.


## Rules

- To win the game, all questions must be answered correctly
- If answered correctly, the player will advance to the next question
- If answered wrong, the game ends and display how many correct answers were give


## Further futures and fixes

- [ ] First page
- [ ] Retrieve questions from database in JSON format
- [ ] Randomize questions order
- [ ] Implement helpers: call a friend, 50-50 and ask the public options
- [ ] Set levels of difficulty as the game advances closer to finish (star with easy questions, continue with medium level one and finish having to answer to difficult questions)
